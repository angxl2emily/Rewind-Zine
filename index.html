                Hedy Lamarr was born in Vienna, Austria on November 9, 1914. Both of her parents were Jewish. 
                Most well known for her acting career, Lamarr was discovered as a teenager and gained international 
                fame from her role in Ecstasy, where she appeared nude (scandalous for that time). Her looks were an 
                inspiration for some of the most well known cartoons, including Snow White and Catwoman, and she was 
                referred to as the most beautiful and "exotic" (she had a non-American accent when she came to Hollywood) 
                woman in the world.

                Above is an Italian poster that was created for Lamarr's World War II film, The Conspirators. 
                Her picture was made to reflect the allure that led to her title of "most beautiful woman in the world."

        <h1 class="secTitle">2. Engineering and War</h1>
        <div class="quote">"The world isn't getting any easier. With all these new inventions I believe that people are hurried more and pushed more... 
                            The hurried way is not the right way; you need time for everything - time to work, time to play, time to rest."</div>
        
        <div class="content" id="academic">

                Lamarr married Fritz mandl, who was an Austrian munitions manufacturer. He wasn't particularly great (beyond reports of being verbally abusive 
                toward Lamarr) and once World War II tensions started, he had Nazis dine with them. According to Lamarr, the Germans and other potential buyers 
                discussed secret weapons, which might be how she learned about engineering. Because of the looming fear of war, Lmarr escaped her country, got a 
                divorce, and ventured to Hollywood in 1937.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lamarr didn't enjoy the fame and attention she received from her movie roles. Instead, she believed it was shallow, and wanted to do something good 
                with her success. At a party, she met a composer named George Antheil, who was famous for using unconventional instruments, such as synchronized pianos, 
                in one of his symphonies. The two became partners, with Lamarr designing and Antheil creating models. Here, Lamarr's engineering hobby took hold and 
                she wondered if they could create a secret communications system to prevent front line communication from being intercepted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their idea was to synchronize radio signals using something now called frequency hopping. The secret system would be able to guide a torpedo so it 
                couldn't be intercepted by enemies. Lamarr's diagrams are shown below, along with their patent that was filed in 1941.

                Originally, the navy threw her idea away, telling her she should go raise money for the war instead of engineering ideas. Once again, 
                Lamarr was reduced to her beauty, her brains ignored. However, she still wanted to do good, so she did as the navy told her, and went on to use her 
                fame to raise millions in war bonds.
            </p>
            <p>
                After World War II, as Lamarr's stardom began to fade into the background, she watched other inventors use "frequency hopping" in new technology. 
                Although her patent's expiration date was in 1959, in the 50s, the navy shared Lamarr's concept with a contractor to create a sonobuoy, which allows airplanes to detect submarines.
            </p>
            <p>

                Eventually, Hedy Lamarr quietly signed her patent over to the navy, and never made any money from it all.

                The end of Lamarr's story feels quite tragic: 50 years after her original patent, she received some acknowledgement for her work, however due to botched plastic surgery, 
                she didn't show up to awards and mostly kept to herself. She died alone in 2000 at the age of 85. Her obituaries made little references to, as CBS news put it, 
                "the invention she hoped would prove her mind was beautiful, too."

                Today, her idea of frequency hopping is used in many technologies that we depend on, including the wifi you're using to read this article! 
                Most military communication systems as well as GPS' also depend on frequency hopping to function.
